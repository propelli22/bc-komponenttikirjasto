            <h2>About this project</h2>
            <p>This project was made for a zoo that is not real :), The point of the project was to learn the basics of React.</p>
            <p>These are some of the functions that this project does/uses</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The entire website uses one page, it just only displays the nesecary elements of the page</li>
                <li>When the user hovers over a button, the button changes the apearance to show that a mouse is over it</li>
                <li>Search funtions on the animal and bird pages to search for a specific animal</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This project taught me the basics of react as it is different to just read the materials than to actualy make us of it. I did put effort into the visual style of the page but it wasn't my top priority so it isn't the best.</p>
        </div>
